The following Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) learning resources are available to help you understand the concepts behind and use of the OSCAL [models](/concepts/layer/).

### Concepts

The [concepts](./concepts/) section contains detailed information about the organization of OSCAL models, processing specifications, and explanations of important primitives (i.e. identifiers) underlying OSCAL data elements.

### Walkthrough Tutorials

The [tutorials](./tutorials/) section provides step-by-step walk-throughs explaining how to create OSCAL content of various types, such as:

- [general topic tutorials](./tutorials/general/)
  - [Using the metadata section](./tutorials/general/metadata/): Explains use of the `metadata` section that is required to be provided in all OSCAL content.
  - [Extending OSCAL models](./tutorials/general/extension/): Discusses how to use OSCAL properties and links to provided extended data in OSCAL content.
  - [Testing new releases](./tutorials/general/releases/): Provides a few pointers for community members looking to test new OSCAL releases.

- [control layer tutorials](./tutorials/control/)
  - [Creating a Basic Control Catalog](./tutorials/control/basic-catalog/): Explains how to create a [catalog](/concepts/terminology/#catalog) of [controls](/concepts/terminology/#control) using the OSCAL [catalog model](/concepts/layer/control/catalog/).
  - [Creating a Basic Profile](/learn/tutorials/profile/): Explains how to create and modify a subset of controls from a catalog in OSCAL by using the OSCAL [profile model](/concepts/layer/control/profile/).

- [implementation layer tutorials](./tutorials/implementation/)
  - [Creating a Basic Component Definition](./tutorials/implementation/simple-component-definition/): Teaches how to create a component-definition using the OSCAL [component definition](/concepts/layer/implementation/component-definition/) model.
  - [Representing proof of compliance or test validation information](./tutorials/implementation/validation-modeling/): Describes how to represent test validation information (e.g., FIPS-140-2) using a component in an OSCAL [component definition](/concepts/layer/implementation/component-definition/) or [system security plan](/concepts/layer/implementation/ssp/).
