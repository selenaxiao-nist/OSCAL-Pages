The OSCAL project maintains a variety of resources to learn and use OSCAL.

### OSCAL Reference

The [reference](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference) section contains the full details of all OSCAL models for development snapshots and all published releases, with visualizations of models in [outline form](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/#:~:text=.-,Outline%20Pages), [reference documentation](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/#:~:text=.-,Reference%20Pages) for individual elements, and [indices](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/#:~:text=.-,Index%20Pages) for the location of all elements across all models.

For each released model, outline entries are linked to their corresponding references. For example, the [Catalog](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/develop/catalog/) outline for the latest [development snapshot](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/develop/catalog/) is provided in [XML](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/develop/catalog/xml-outline/) and in [JSON/YAML](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/develop/catalog/json-outline/) formats. In each format, the outline entries are linked to their definitions and constraints.


### Examples

The [examples](./examples/) page has links and information to examples of OSCAL content in the official NIST repositories.

### Tools

The [tools](./tools) page has information about NIST's reference implementations of software and reusable libraries. Additionally, there are links to community-maintained lists of software and information about OSCAL-enabled tools.

### Downloads

The [downloads](./downloads/) page has links and instructions to download releases and development snapshots of the OSCAL data models.
